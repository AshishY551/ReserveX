fix(admin-profile): corrected image path and added required width/height to Next.js Image component

- Moved AdminAvatar.jpeg to the /public/Image/admin/ directory for proper access in Next.js App Router.
- Replaced <img> tag with Next.js <Image> component to leverage image optimization features.
- Added required `width` and `height` props to resolve runtime error in Next.js 15.
- Ensured admin profile avatar loads correctly and maintains expected rounded UI styling.
