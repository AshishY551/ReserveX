feat(dashboard): fix dashboard modal/tab issues & improve UX

- Resolved auto-redirect issue when switching tabs or reopening modals
- Fixed improper import from `framer-motion`:
  ⛔️ Removed: `import * as framer from 'framer-motion'`
  ✅ Used: `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`
- Fixed issue caused by `export * from 'motion-dom'` in `index.mjs`:
  ⛔️ Removed conflicting wildcard export to prevent runtime modal/tab crashes
- Refactored Dashboard layout to:
  - Keep state persistent on tab change
  - Ensure correct modal mount/unmount logic
- Updated modal visibility logic to avoid unwanted redirects
- Improved framer motion integration with correct usage of `<motion.div>` and key transitions
- Ensured no memory leaks or DOM errors during client-side navigation
- Added fallback condition to prevent modal triggering unintended routes
- Verified full responsiveness and cross-tab support
