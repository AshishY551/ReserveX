feat(dashboard): migrate Reservation Trends chart to client component with useRef and Line chart integration

- Added 'use client' directive at the top of the ReservationTrendsChart component file to enable usage of React Client Hooks like useRef (fixes Next.js Runtime Error: "useRef only works in Client Components").
- Implemented chart rendering using Chart.js Line chart (`react-chartjs-2`) with updated responsive configuration.
- Enhanced `chartOptions` with modern UX styling:
  - Custom legend position and label styling using Tailwind-inspired colors (#4B5563, #9CA3AF, etc.).
  - Grid and tick colors for improved contrast and dashboard aesthetics.
- Confirmed the `useRef()` functionality now works within the client component, preventing server-side rendering violations.
- Improved chart container with shadow, padding, rounded edges for polished look.
- Set up the component for future expansion: dynamic data input via props or API.

ðŸ’¡ This change ensures chart interactivity is properly handled on the client, and the component is future-proof for advanced dashboard analytics.
